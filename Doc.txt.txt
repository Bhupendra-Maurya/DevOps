DevOps is a collaborative approach that unifies software development and IT operations, aiming to streamline and automate the entire software delivery lifecycle. By fostering a culture of communication and shared responsibility, DevOps bridges the gap between development teams creating code and operations teams managing infrastructure. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are at the core of DevOps, enabling rapid and reliable software releases. This methodology emphasizes iterative improvements, faster feedback loops, and the ability to respond swiftly to changing market demands. Ultimately, DevOps empowers organizations to deliver high-quality software more efficiently, enhancing both their competitiveness and customer satisfaction.
